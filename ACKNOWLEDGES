This software is written to be used as part of cyber security courses, it is not
intended to be a real website and it exposes common vulnerabilities.

The development of this software is inspired by the book How to Break Web Software (2006) 
by Mike Andrews and James A. Whittaker, as well as other vulnerable websites for pentesting
such as BadStore and Damn Vulnerable Web Application.

Some parts of the source code is written with assistance from ChatGPT, and most graphical

Images of products are based on photos taken by Bengt Østby, of physical lockpicks from
companies Sparrows and Multipick, the design and logos of those companies are owned by
those companies respectivly, and the use of these pictures in this software does not show
any affiliation with those companies nor that they endorse this software, I have also not
been paid by those companies for advertisement or "product placing".
